# PORTFOLIO

## Portfolio site showcasing the projects I've completed during my Full-Stack Software Engineering course run by The Jump.

### Built using React on the frontend and Node.js (Express) on the backend, with a MongoDB database.

The portfolio is fully responsive and features adaptive project images, which change according to the screen size and display corresponding device mock ups for each project.

Backend is [here](https://github.com/fredpostles/portfolio-backend).

### Still in progress:

- Responsive project images for Make Food Not Waste
- Bug fixing - e.g. error message caused by React Helmet to be fixed.

### To work on in future:

- Expand backend to feature admin user to update projects and upload images.
